###Overview
The requirements for our final project were for it to be built as a fully authenticated full stack web application using 
Ruby-on-Rails. It would also use PostGreSQL on the backend with JavaScript and AngularJS on the frontend. For my final project
I decided to create a social networking site for video gamers that utilizing a profile and feedback/review system.


###Aim
* To build a full stack application from scratch, using Ruby-on-Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, AngularJS, HTML and SCSS
* To include multiple relationships and CRUD actions for at least two models
* To implement thoughtful planning and wire-framing to achieve satisfactory user journey and determine MVP
* To have a working app by deadline, deployed to Heroku
* To present my project to the rest of the group, explaining how the app functions and my working process

###Process
* First I fleshed out a few choices from a shortlist of initial possible ideas
* Once I had my project decided, I began wireframing and figured out what my MVP would be
* Next I created a Trello board to plan my steps, ordered by priority using a traffic light system
* I worked on my ERDs to decide what fields would be on each model and how each model was related
* Next I created my back-end using Ruby-on-Rails and PostGreSQL
* Once the back-end was complete, I tested RESTful routes were all working (with authentication) using Insomnia
* Next I began to build the front-end using JavaScript and AngularJS. I caught the front-end up to the back-end functionality
* Once I had a basic CRUD app working on the front-end I could add some extra functionality
* I added Bootstrap UI and began to style the site
* I spent the last day adding finishing touches to styling and bug-fixing/testing

###Challenges faced
* Getting the profiles to show only according to which game they were assigned to and moreover making sure that only reviews that were assigned to the current profile would be displayed.
* Getting to grips with making sure that the relationships were set up correctly, if they were not... then it could bring the entire project to a halt.

###Steps for improvement
* I'm planning to add some more CSS to make it more appealing, as styling took a backseat towards the end as hitting MVP was more of a priority
* I plan to create more options for users so that they can view all of the profiles that they have set up and also all of the reviews that they have written, this should not be too difficult as all of the backend is already set up and working.
